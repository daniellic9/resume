# Resume
Personal resume written in latex, in order to show some of my work, education and experience.

## Editing
If you want to edit the file, change the ```Guilherme.tex``` file with your information. As you can see on the comments, there are
some rules you can change to make your resume as you wish. The rules are:

- Font size
- Paper size
- Font families
- CV theme
- CV color

The options are written on the comments after the rules.

## Building and Converting
To build your resume and convert it to pdf (it originally creates a .dvi file), type:

```
chmod +x build.sh (just the first time)
./build.sh
```
To compile this resume on Debian Based you can download ```texlive-full```, with this command:  

```
sudo apt-get install texlive-full
```

Feel free to fork and contact me.
